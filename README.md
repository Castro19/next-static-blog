## Introduction

Hello! My name is Cristian Castro Oliva and this will be a static blog site using Next JS and Tailwind to convert markdown files into HTML. I will try to post daily to document my struggles, accomplishments, and dedication in software development. Feel free to fork this repo, and create your own blog site as well!

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
