# April 1, 2024

Welcome to my project diary for Spring 2024. Today, I'll share insights into my project goals, what I've achieved, and what I've learned.

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

**LAEP ChatBot Project**

- Fix the formatting of API response
  - Tasks:
    1. Find an approach to convert the JSON response to HTML.
    2. Finish converting the JSON to HTML
    3. If time, try to use the `stream: True` in the OpenAI API parameter to allow text to get written out continuously while the response finishes

**Static Blog Site**

- Previously, I found a way to utilize `tailwindcss/typography` plugin to format my HTML text. However, I now need to implement it into my next static blog site and ensure it works correctly.
  - Tasks:
    1. Install Tailwind CSS and initialize it in project.
    2. Change the styling of my styles to use Tailwind CSS.
    3. Format the Blog Post to use `className="prose mx-auto"`.

## âœ… Achievements

**- LAEP ChatBot UI Development**

- The approach I decided to take was to prompt the system to send each response in a markdown format. - Since, I am already learning how to convert Markdown --> HTML, this seemed like the right approach to take. - I used `markdown-it` to convert the markdown response to HTML, and it worked perfectly!

- The next streaming feature for the text presented a challenge. Unfortunately, I was unable to complete this and I will continue to do more research on different approaches.

**Static Blog Site**

- Implementing Tailwind into my existing Next App was more difficult than I had imagined. I want to do more research on why it was so difficult, and I am assuming it has something to do with the initial setup installing or not installing certain packages.
- I ended up creating a new next application and choosing to include Tailwind CSS setup using `npx create-next-app@latest ...`.
- After creating a new Next app, I just moved my existing code, and applying CSS styles and `className="prose mx-auto"` to my BlogPage component.
- Once I created the new Next app, everything went smoothly, but I do wish I had done this sooner.

## ðŸ“š Learnings

- Sometimes, it is better to reset and start from the beginning. This is a lesson I learned when trying to add Tailwind styles to my already existing Next app.
- Learning how to convert large pieces of text in markdown format to HTML with Tailwind.

## ðŸ”œ Next Steps

- Continue working on the stream feature for the LAEP chatbot and work on building a main menu of options for different modes of AI chatbots.
- Create a search bar and a filter menu for my homepage of the blog and continue working on the styles.
