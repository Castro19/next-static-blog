## Class Today

**Intro to Software Engineering (CSC 307)**

- In today's lecture, we were taught a brief introduction on what software is and how it is used in our society.

**Small Group Communication (COMS 217)**

- Today's class was an introduction and review of the syllabus.

- Something I found interesting is that my professor spent over 20 years living in New York, which is where my Squarespace internship will take place.
  - I look forward to asking her about her experience and advice!

## Next JS

- After building my blog site, by following a YouTube video and an outdated web article using Next 12, I wanted to gain a stronger understanding of exactly how it works. Here are some notes I took today while reading through the documentation.

## ðŸ”œ Next Steps

- Tomorrow, I will need to finish all the assignments for the week I have, so I can focus on building the LAEP chatbot.

- Today I was unable to meet my schedule, and I got home feeling drained, so I wasn't able to work on the LAEP project or do any CodeWars problems.
  - As a result, I will likely modify the structure for my Monday/Wednesday classes.
  - I will also promise myself to do better tomorrow.

## Schedule

- I find myself to be more productive when I plan my schedule a day ahead. So a new heading will now be added to every blog post that creates a schedule for the next day.

- The following schedule will be for tommorow (Thursday).

- This will likely be my schedule every Tuesday and Thursday.

  **8:00AM - 9:00AM:** Gym

  **9:40AM - 11:00AM** Computer Security Lecture

  **11:00AM - 12:00PM:** Break in between lecture & lab, work on assignments.
