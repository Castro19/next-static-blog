# April 4, 2024

Today I will focus on completing all my school assignments to prepare to work all weekend on the LAEP Project.

**Intro to Computer Security Lecture**

- In today's lecture, we learned about the acronym **CIA**.

  **Confidentiality:** Data is not distributed (read/view) to unauthorized parties.

  **Integrity:** Data is not modified (write) by unauthorized parties.

  **Accessibility:** Assuming authorization, a user must be able to access their data when requested.

## Learning Node JS

- I decided today to focus on learning Node JS because it will be used in the backend for my LAEP project and I will need to learn it for my Into to SWE class.

  - I am new to Node JS, however, I am familar with using back-end systems like Python Flask and Django.

  - Since I understand the basic concepts of API requests, routes, and a strong foundation of JavaScript, the concepts of Node JS made a lot of sense.

  - Here are some of the notes I took for Node JS:

## LAEP Chatbot

- I implemented 3 new features onto the LAEP chatbot today:

  1.) **Modularizing Functions:** I created a utils folder for some helper functions to make the code easier to read.

  2.) **Handling Message Lengths:** A user's message can now only be a maximum length of 2000 characters. When the message gets to 1500 characters, a message lets them know how many words they are at.

  3.) **Loading Icon:** Since messages, take a while to complete. I disabled the send button while the message is processing and replaced it with a React icon that has a leading animation.

- Here are photo snippets showcasing some of the improvements made:

## ðŸ”œ Next Steps

- Tomorrow, I will continue working on the LAEP chatbot.

  - I noticed there is a problem on the back-end when testing it on my mobile device.
  - I will try to find the issue causing this and I believe it could be a Cors issue.

- Go more in-depth on learning Node JS for the LAEP project and my into to SWE Class

- Learn Next JS concepts more to improve this static blog site.

## Conclusion

- Overall, today was a 7/10 productivity wise. I went to the gym in the morning and attended lecture/lab for my security class. I also made progress on the LAEP project and learned some useful concepts on Node JS.

  - Today I could have improved on my work efficiency when I arrived home at 2:00PM. I could have also been working more after I ate dinner at 7:00PM.

- I also talked with my best friend from back home, and it was great to end the day catching up with him. Shout out Zac!
