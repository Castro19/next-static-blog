# April 6, 2024

Today, I will continue to work on the LAEP chatbot and Next.js static blog site.

- I want to implement the front-end display for the sidebar display on the LAEP chatbot.

- For the Static blog site, I want to modify the UI display and see if I can make it look better.

**LAEP Chatbot**

- Today, I implemented three new improvements and one new feature.

  - The new feature was implementing the **sidebar**, which will where the chat logs will go. The next step will be to begin inserting these chat logs.

- The 3 new improvements:

  1. **Horizontal Transition:** for sidebar

  - The horizontal transition was easy to do with tailwind as I could just add a transition property to the className.

  2. **Vertical Transition:** for Chatbot Mode drop down menu.

  - **Problem:** The vertical transition was trickier because I had to figure out how far down the element should transition.

  - **Solution:** Assign the dropdown menu as a ref to calculate its max vertical height, so I knew how far the transition should go.

  3. **Icons:** New icons for the header using `react-icons`.

## Working on Next JS Static Blog Site

- Today, I wanted to start making the UI of the static blog site better by adding in a sorting element.

- While researching, I stumbled upon the **shadcn ui** library. I decided to implement this into my project.

  - I faced some challenges implementing this library into my existing project, here are some of the problems and solutions I implemented.

    - **Problem 1:** My old Tailwind CSS styles to style the markdown to HTML was no longer working.

    - **Solution 1:** My existing configuration in the tailwind.config.js got overwritten, so I had to edit this to keep using my plugins.

    - **Problem 2:** I was unable to add my own tailwind styles to the shadcn components.

    - **Solution 2:** When initializing this component library, I overlooked a step in the installation process to add and modify a **components.json.**

      - I created this file and added this:

        ```
        "tailwind": {
          "config": "tailwind.config.js",
          "css": "styles/globals.css",
          "baseColor": "slate",
          "cssVariables": false,
          "prefix": ""
        },
        ```

      - Once I added this, I was able to use tailwind utility classes to style these added components.
        - Specifically this line was the major change: **"cssVariables": false,**

## ðŸ”œ Next Steps

- **LAEP Project:** Add functionality for the chat log side bar

- **Static Blog Site:** Add more shadcn ui components to make the site look more appealing.

## Conclusion

- Overall, today was another 7/10 productivity wise.

**The Good:**

- Productivity in the morning was going extremely well and I felt very focused working on the LAEP chatbot.

- In the afternoon, I was also very productive working on the static blog site.

**The Bad:** After 4:00PM, I wanted to take a small break, however, this led to me getting stuck watching YouTube on my phone for about 2 hours.

**The fix:** I already deleted the YouTube app and I have restrictions set up for screen time on my phone, but I would like to find stronger measures to prevent future instances where I am glued to my phone.

- I will begin by limiting where and how I take breaks. I will try to take breaks by doing something productive downstairs like cooking or going on a small walk.
