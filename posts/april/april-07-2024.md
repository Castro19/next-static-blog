# April 7, 2024

Today, I will continue to work on the LAEP chatbot and make major improvements.

**LAEP Chatbot**

- Today, I implemented three major updates:

  1. **CI/CD:** Utilizing Github Actions, I was able to create two new yaml files within tthe `.github/workflows/` directory to setup my continuous integration and continuous deployment workflows.

     - **CI:** This process automates the building, linting, and setting up both client-side and server-side parts of the web app every time a push or pull request is made to the main branch.
     - **CD:** Using my free student credits from Microsoft Azure, I have set up the application to be deployed to host on Azure. I am still working through this part to get my content deployed correctly.

  2. **Context State variable:** While implementing the sidebar logic, I ran into a lot of tedious work through prop drilling. Since most of my components shared the same state, I decided to create 3 new context custom hooks and wrap them around my entire project.

     - Performance wise, this might be an issue that I will need to look at and full-understand how state changes for these context variables will render my component(s).

  3. **SideBar Logic:** The sidebar now stores previous chat logs, and users can now resume previous chat logs.

     - Each chat log contains a title, timestamp (when the chat was created), and the content of messages that gets displayed onto the message container.

## ðŸ”œ Next Steps

- **LAEP Project:** While functionality is now working in the sidebar, it is not perfect. So I will continue to adjust bugs and make sure it works in all cases.

  - Continuous Deployment will also need to host and work correctly on Microsoft Azure. I will look at documentation, change my yaml workflow file, and use the azure app service VSCode extension to accomplish this.

- **Static Blog Site:** I did not work on the static blog site today, but I will try to find time to fix the UI for it before I host it on Github to showcase my work.

## Conclusion

- Overall, today was an 8.5/10 productivity wise.

**The Good:**

- I was extremely focused throughout the entire day from 7:00AM - 9:00PM, which was great.

- I accomplished many different tasks around the LAEP chatbot, and I made a lot of progress.

**The Reason:**

- I only worked on the LAEP chatbot, so it made it easier to take breaks and jump right back into work without a delay.
  - _Immersing_ myself into a single project is something that has always helped me improve focus.
  - I will continue to do less things during my day and keep it simple to re-recreate this productiveness.
- I also worked on challenging tasks that I was unable to fully finish.
  - Implementing the sidebar logic created a lot of changes, and it was challenging to get it working the way I wanted.
  - Implementing CI/CD was also challenging as I was using Azure when I am more familar with Heroku. I am also not used to created yaml workflow files.
- Working on challenging tasks took more time to complete, which made me more focused throughout the day.
  - I will continue to do more difficult tasks, so I can increase my work performance.

**The Bad:** While I worked for almost the entire day, there were many instances when I just felt stuck.

- During the Continuous Deployment from 7:00PM - 9:00PM, I ran into issues loading the content from my website onto azure. I was stuck troubleshooting this problem for about 2 hours and I never fixed it.

**The fix:** Looking at Documentation when I get stuck is something I need to more of and earlier. I would also like to take more breaks to reset my brain.
