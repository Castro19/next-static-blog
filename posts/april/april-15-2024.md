# April 15, 2024

- Today, I will spend most of time working on my coding projects. I will also finish the Security Lab assignment.

## LAEP Meeting

- Today's meeting consisted of reviewing tasks that need to be completed such as the following:
  1. **Web Scraping:** Retreiving data on CalPoly advisors from the CalPoly website.
  2. **OpenAI agents:** Using features in API to allow us to perform tasks besides text generation.
  3. **PDF Form Filling:** Auto-filling PDF forms through messages with the OpenAI API.

## CCC-Helper

- Today, I worked on implementing the back-end in Python Django for this project. This consisted of the following.
  - Utilizing the ASSIST API to create my own JSON files of college data.
  - Submitting requests for college data based on what the user chooses as their options from the homepage.

## Intro to SWE Lecture

- In today's lecture we learned about MCV Architecure, Promises, and React Hooks. I already had a good understanding on promises and react hooks but I did not know what MVC Architecture was, so that was nice to learn.

  - Model-View-Controller **(MVC):** Divides the application into three internconnected components to design web applications.

    1. **Model:** The central component that directly manages the data, logic, and rules of the application.

    - Defines data structure (e.g. updates application to reflect added item)
    - Model updates the View to show the added item

    2. **View:** Presents the data to the user.

    - Multiple views of the same info are possible
    - Defines display UI (e.g. user clicks `add to cart`)
    - View sends input from user to the controller

    3. **Controller:** The interface between model and view components to process all the business logic & handle incoming requests.

    - Contains control logic (e.g. receives update from view then notifies model to `add item`)
    - Manipulates data using the model component
      Sometimes updates the View directly

## Conclusion

- Today was an 7/10 productivity-wise.

- **The Good:**

  - Today's meeting was about an hour, and we discuessed valuable topics regarding the next steps for the LAEP project. I also got a lot of work done on the CCC-Helper project, and progress is looking good at the moment.

- ## **The Bad:**

  - After the LAEP meeting finished at 6:00PM, I did take a long break before I went to the gym at 7:00PM. For future instances, I would like to go to the gym immediately or cook a meal or be productive in another way.
