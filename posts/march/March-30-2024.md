      const numString = num.toString();
      const numArr = numString.split("");
      let resList = [];

      numArr.forEach((char) => {
        const numInt = char - "0";
        resList.push(numInt * numInt);
      });
      console.log(resList);

      const resString = resList.join("") - "0";
      return resString;
    }
    ```
