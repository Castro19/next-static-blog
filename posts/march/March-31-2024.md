## ðŸš€ Project Goals

**LAEP ChatBot Project**

- Implement the server-side logic and OpenAI API
  - Tasks:
    1. Choose an ideal back-end framework
    2. Initialize the back-end framework
    3. Create the route to the server to respond to client requests with the OpenAI API

**Static Blog Site**

- Continue learning Next JS and working on building a Static Blog Site markdown to JSX

## âœ… Achievements

**LAEP ChatBot UI Development**

- Progress:
  - I chose Node.js and Express for the back-end of this project. I am new to Node.js and Express, but after some research this seemed like the best fit for my project due to the use of React and the handling of asynchronous requests.
  - I also added more Tailwind styles and used a dark mode layout to make the UI look more appealing.

**Static Blog Site**

- Progress:

  - Today's challenge was learning how to nicely format markdown files for my blog. I mainly struggled with bullet point indentation, but after some research, I found a solution in Tailwind CSS.
  - Fortunately, Tailwind offers an amazing plugin that formats markdown content automatically. After installing with `npm install -D @tailwindcss/typography` and adding it to the `plugins` array in `tailwind.config.js` as `require('@tailwindcss/typography')`, the appearance of my blog posts improved drastically.
  - Overall, this plugin's ability to enhance readability made my life a lot easier, and I will continue experimenting with different styles to create a sleek UI.

## ðŸ”œ Next Steps

**LAEP ChatBot UI Development**

- Modify the text sent from the API to include newlines, tabs, and be neatly formatted to the chat display.

**Static Blog Site**

- Continue working on the Static Blog Site and enhance organization in my project directory by adding subfolders for the months.
- Create a filter to look through posts by months
- Add images to my blog posts, and card previews in the main menu
